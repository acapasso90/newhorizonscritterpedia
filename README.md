Interactive Critterpedia from Animal Crossing New Horizons built with React utilizing the ACNH API found here: [http://acnhapi.com/]. By default shows catchable fish/bugs/sea creatures using the current Month and Time for Northern Hemisphere. Hemisphere/Month/Time is able to be changed with buttons or dropdowns and each creature is clickable for a pop-up with more information such as sell price, location, and availability.
